// CS High score leaderboard
/*Write a program that manages a high score leaderboard for a game using file I/O in C++. 
The program should allow the user to add new high scores, view the existing leaderboard, and save the data to a text file. 
It should also read data from the file when the program starts. 
The user menu should include options to add a new score, display the high scores, and exit. 
The program must handle invalid inputs gracefully and continue running until the user chooses to exit.*/
