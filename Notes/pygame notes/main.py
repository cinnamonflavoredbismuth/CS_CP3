#CS Pygame Notes
"""
How do you set up pygame?
    pygame.init()
What is the purpose of the "While running" loop?
    so the program keeps running and doesn't close immediately
How do you create a screen in pygame?
    pygame.display.set_mode((1200, 720))
How are objects placed on the screen in pygame?
    screen.blit or screen.draw
What events can I listen for in pygame? What do those events do?
    exit, keypress, mouse click, mouse movement
How can I detect collision with pygame?
   
How do you add sounds in pygame?
    pygame.mixer.sound.play(pygame.mixer.Sound('soundfile.wav'))
